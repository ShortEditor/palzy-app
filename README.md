# Palzy: College Social Feed

Palzy is a React-based progressive web app (PWA) that provides a campus-focused social feed for college students. Users can post text, images, and quote cards; react with emojis; comment; follow peers; explore trending content; view campus-specific posts (doubts, notes, collaborations); and receive real-time notifications. The app includes an admin dashboard for content moderation and user management.

**Tagline:** *Your campus. Your vibe. Connect with your crowd.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20.x
- npm >= 10.x (or yarn)
- A Firebase project (with Authentication and Firestore enabled)
- A Cloudinary account (free tier is sufficient)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Project Social Media"
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example`):
```dotenv
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_unsigned_upload_preset
```
> **Note**: Never commit your actual `.env` file. Keep it local only.

## Firebase Setup
1. **Create a Firebase project** in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Enable Email/Password and Google providers.
3. **Enable Cloud Firestore**:
   - Start in test mode (optional) then replace with the provided security rules.
4. **Deploy Firestore Rules and Indexes**:
   - Copy `firestore.rules` to your Firestore rules tab.
   - Copy `firestore.indexes.json` to your Firestore indexes tab (or deploy via Firebase CLI).
5. **Add your Firebase config values** to the `.env` file (see above).

## Cloudinary Setup
1. **Create a Cloudinary account** at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/).
2. **Note your Cloud Name** from the dashboard.
3. **Create an unsigned upload preset**:
   - Go to Settings → Upload → Upload presets.
   - Add an upload preset, set Signing Mode to **Unsigned**, and save.
   - Note the preset name.
4. **Add your Cloud Name and unsigned upload preset** to the `.env` file (see above).

## Running the App
- **Development** (hot reload):
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).
- **Linting**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Production Build**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  Outputs to the `dist/` directory.
- **Preview Production Build**:
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

## Deployment

### Firebase Hosting
1. Install the Firebase CLI (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```
2. Log in to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```
3. Initialize your project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```
   - Select Hosting.
   - Choose your Firebase project.
   - Set `dist` as the public directory.
   - Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all URLs to `/index.html`).
   - Do not overwrite existing files unless prompted.
4. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Vercel
1. Install the Vercel CLI (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```
2. Log in:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Confirm the project settings (framework: Vite, root directory: project root).
   - Vercel will detect the `vercel.json` config (rewrites to `index.html`).

## PWA and Installation
- The app is configured as a Progressive Web App.
- On supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari), an **Install Banner** appears on first visit (or after clearing site data).
- Users can install the app to their home screen or desktop for an app-like experience.
- The install banner respects the user's choice and uses `sessionStorage` to avoid repeated prompts.
- Service workers cache static assets and use a network-first strategy for Firebase API calls (with short-term caching) to ensure fresh data.

## Development Workflow
### Adding a New Feature
1. **UI Components**: Add or modify components in `src/components/`.
2. **Image Uploads**: If the feature involves image uploads, use `uploadImage` from `src/utils/cloudinary.js`.
3. **Firestore Changes**:
   - If adding new collections or fields, update `firestore.rules` and `firestore.indexes.json` as needed.
   - Update the relevant service file in `src/firebase/` (e.g., `posts.js`, `follows.js`).
4. **Lint and Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Test**: Verify the feature works in development and production builds.

### Admin Tasks
- Use the admin pages (`/admin/*`) to manage users, posts, and reports.
- Admin functions are in `src/firebase/admin.js`.

### Testing
- The repository does not include unit or integration tests by default.
- Consider adding Vitest/Jest for unit testing and Cypress/Playwright for end-to-end tests if needed.

### PWA Testing
- To test the install flow:
  1. Open the app in Chrome.
  2. Open DevTools → Application → Manifest.
  3. Click "Install" or use the Install Banner.
- After a production build, check the Service Worker tab in DevTools to verify caching.

## Architecture Overview
- **Entry Point**: `src/main.jsx` wraps the app with `ThemeProvider`, `BrowserRouter`, and `AuthProvider`.
- **Routing**: `src/App.jsx` defines lazy-loaded routes and route guards (`ProtectedRoute`, `AdminRoute`).
- **Layout**: `src/components/AppShell.jsx` renders the sidebar (desktop) or bottom nav (mobile) and includes the `InstallBanner`.
- **State**:
  - `AuthContext`: Manages Firebase auth state, user profile, and auth methods.
  - `ThemeContext`: Manages dark/light mode.
- **Data Layer**: Each Firebase feature has a module in `src/firebase/`:
  - `users.js`: Profile CRUD, cache, streak logic.
  - `posts.js`: Post CRUD, feed algorithm, likes, comments.
  - `follows.js`: Follow/unfollow, friend suggestions, count sync.
  - `notifications.js`: Notification creation, real-time listeners.
  - `reactions.js`: Emoji reaction toggle and counts.
  - `stories.js`: 24-hour story lifecycle.
  - `campus.js`, `doubts.js`, `leaderboard.js`: Campus-specific queries.
  - `admin.js`: Admin-only functions.
- **Utilities**:
  - `src/utils/cloudinary.js`: Image upload to Cloudinary (with compression).
  - `src/utils/quoteCardRenderer.js`: Canvas-based quote card generation.
  - `src/utils/recapCardRenderer.js`: Weekly recap card generation.
  - `src/utils/shareUtils.js`: Native share API wrapper.
- **Styling**: `src/index.css` defines CSS variables and global reset.
- **PWA Configuration**: `vite.config.js` includes the `VitePWA` plugin with manifest and workbox settings.

## Known Issues / Uncertain Areas
1. **Story Image Upload**: The `CreateStoryModal` component attempts to import `uploadToCloudinary` from `../utils/cloudinary`, but the utility only exports `uploadImage`. This will cause a runtime error if story image uploads are attempted. Fix: rename the import or update the utility.
2. **Unused Firestore Rules for `emojiReactions`**: The Firestore rules file defines rules for an `emojiReactions/{reactionId}` collection, but the app stores emoji reactions in the `likes` collection. This rules block is currently unused.
3. **Firebase Storage Configured but Unused**: The `storageBucket` is set in the Firebase config and `.env.example`, but no Firebase Storage SDK calls exist. All image uploads go through Cloudinary.
4. **Client-Side Filtering for Campus Board**: The Campus Board queries (doubts, notes, collabs) fetch a pool of recent posts and filter client-side by tags. This may miss tagged posts beyond the pool limit and does not scale with volume.
5. **ReelCard Component**: The `ReelCard` component exists but is not imported or used by any page or component. Its purpose and status are unclear.
